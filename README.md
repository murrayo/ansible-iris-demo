# Welcome 

I have created some example Ansible modules that add functionality above and beyond simply using the Ansible builtin Command or Shell modules to manage IRIS. 
 You can use these as an inspiration for creating your own modules. 
 My hope is that this will be the start of creating an IRIS community Ansible collection.
